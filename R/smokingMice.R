# Data Normalization
# CPM (Count per million)
# CPM = read counts of gene * 10^6 / Total mapping
# Scale log2(CPM + 0.5)

# Filter non expressed genes

# Quality control
# Delete bad quality samples
# Metrics as mitoRate and rRNA_Rate
  # We expect the rRNA read to be low
  # We expect mitocondrial RNA to be low, indicating
  # the cells were properly lised.

# Detect outliers

# PCA
  # Curation

# Variables correlation
  # Identify if interest variable is correlated with another variable
  # Delete correlated variables

# Differential Expression
# Get B coefficients
# voom(
# lmc()
# eBayes()

# BoxPlots DEGs
